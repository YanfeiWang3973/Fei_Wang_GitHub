## About Me
I’m transitioning into data and analytics with a background in IT support, business analysis, and operations.
I’ve:
- Cleaned and modeled data for reporting (Excel, SQL Server, Power BI)
- Built dashboards for sales, customer behavior, and product performance
- Worked hands-on with stakeholders to explain insights in plain language

Technical areas I use:  
**SQL, Power BI (DAX, parameters, slicers), Tableau, Python (data prep & ML), Excel (Power Query, VLOOKUP, Pivot).**

## Featured Projects

### 1. Retail Sales & Customer Insights Dashboard (Power BI)
**Goal:** Understand profit, territory performance, reseller quality, RFM segmentation, and cross-sell opportunities.  
**What I built:**  
- Data model linking FactSales to dimensions (Product, Customer, Reseller, Territory, Date)  
- DAX measures for KPIs like profit margin, period-over-period trend, customer segmenting  
- Market basket analysis & Pareto to identify upsell bundles  
**Business value:**  
- Which regions drive profit  
- Which resellers underperform  
- Which products should be bundled together  
- Which customer groups are high-value and need retention strategy

### 2. Credit Risk Model (Machine Learning)
**Goal:** Predict which loan applicants are likely to default.  
**Tools:** Python (pandas, scikit-learn, lightgbm), Google Colab  
**Process:**  
- Cleaned nulls, encoded categorical fields, binned continuous vars  
- Train/test split + class balancing (upsampling minority class)  
- Trained Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM  
- Compared ROC curves  
**Result:** ~0.62 test accuracy on reduced dataset (200k rows due to Colab RAM).  
**Learning:** Feature engineering & imbalanced classification workflow.

### 3. Web Scraping – Rental Market Analysis
**Goal:** Scrape rental listings, clean the data, and analyze price patterns.  
**Tools:** Python (requests/bs4), Pandas, Tableau / Power BI for visualization  
**What I did:**  
- Extracted listing price, location, bed/bath, description  
- Cleaned data, removed duplicates/outliers  
- Built dashboard to show price by area  
**Business question:** “What’s fair rent for this area right now?”

### 4. SQL Analytics Projects
**Examples:**
- Customer segmentation and campaign performance
- Credit limit increase monitoring
- Movie rental behavior analysis

I’ve written SQL with:
- joins across multiple tables  
- aggregates / window functions  
- CTEs  
- case logic for customer groups
